# A RNN-based stylometry tutorial based on a Kaggle competition

We live in changing times: With the way our social media activity increases, we now have a shift away from traditional communication towards a text-based one. While these type of messages may have significant advantages and allows us to persist in a globalized world, some question and problem arise we have to face. Undoubtfully, one crucial ability is the identification of an author through its texts; without direct contact, fakes are elsewhere hardly recognizable.
The science of identifying authors by there writing is called Stylometry. With our ability to access big data and having sufficient computational power nowadays, the accuracy we may gain in such kinds of tasks is quite impressive. Upon the data of the [Spooky Author Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification), I present a small tutorial for the usage of RNNs for this purpose.
